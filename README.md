# Task-3 : Simple Python File Reader Script

I’m sharing a small Python program I wrote that asks the user to enter a file name, checks if it exists, and displays its contents. If the file is not found, it shows a clear message and exits.

✅ Checks if the file exists using os.path.exists()
✅ Prevents errors when reading missing files
✅ Great for beginners to learn basic file handling in Python
